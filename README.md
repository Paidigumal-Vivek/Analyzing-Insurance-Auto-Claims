# Analyzing Insurance Auto Claims

## Project Overview
This project analyzes auto insurance claims data to help an insurance company optimize its pricing strategy and improve profitability. The dataset consists of claims filed by customers from the southwest and western regions of the United States. The goal is to identify trends, assess risks, and make data-driven recommendations to enhance business outcomes.

## Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in claim amounts, customer demographics, and risk factors.
- Identify **key factors** influencing claim costs and fraud detection.
- Develop **predictive models** to assess the likelihood of high-risk claims.
- Recommend **policy adjustments** to improve pricing and reduce financial losses.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes fields such as **claim amount, policy type, customer demographics, accident details, and settlement amounts**.
- Missing values and outliers are handled as part of data preprocessing.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and handling missing values.
   - Feature engineering and selection.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing claim distributions and trends.
   - Identifying correlations between customer attributes and claim amounts.
3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Applying machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to assess claim risk.
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Segmenting customers based on claim behavior.
   - Suggesting pricing and policy changes to optimize profitability.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **Machine Learning Models** for risk assessment

## Results
- Key factors influencing claim amounts were identified.
- High-risk claim patterns were analyzed.
- Pricing recommendations were provided to improve the company's profitability.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating **deep learning** models for fraud detection.
- Developing a **real-time dashboard** for claim monitoring.
- Expanding analysis with **additional datasets** to improve predictive accuracy.
